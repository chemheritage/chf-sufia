<%# Sufia uses the homepage layout across many static pages.
    We need to distinguish between general static pages and our frontpage.
    So locally, this isn't actually a homepage layout; it is used for other static pages.
    Our frontpage uses the sufia layout directly. %>
<%# include the search bar on all static pages %>
<% content_for(:navbar) do %>
  <%= render '/controls' %>
<% end %>

<%= render template: 'layouts/sufia' %>
<%= render 'shared/accept_cookies_banner' %>
