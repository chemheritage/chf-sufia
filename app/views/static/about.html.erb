<p>Our Digital Collections offers digitized highlights from CHF's Library, Archival and Museum collections. It represents only a small portion of our entire collection, with new material added every day. More information about our Collections is available <a href="https://www.chemheritage.org/collections">here</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Digital Collections is to offer one central location to manage, preserve and provide access to all of CHFâ€™s digital assets. It is built on the open-source technology stack <a href="http://samvera.org">Samvera</a> (formerly Project Hydra), comprised of Fedora 4, Solr, Blacklight and Ruby on Rails. All of our <a href="https://github.com/chemheritage/chf-sufia">code is freely available</a> on GitHub via an Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<p>This project was made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services grant SP-02-16-0014-16. We also wish to acknowledge the generous support of the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation and Robert W. Gore.</p>
